# Foundations: Landing Page Project

This is my version of the **Landing Page** project from The Odin Project’s *Foundations* course.

## ​ Project Overview

In this assignment, the goal was to build a complete web page based on a provided design, using HTML and CSS. Key objectives included:
- Recreating the layout as closely as possible (not pixel-perfect — more about structure than precision)  
- Leveraging Flexbox for layout tasks, drawing on earlier lessons  
- Building the HTML content first, then applying CSS  
- Personalizing content, colors, and fonts as desired  
- Using legally appropriate images and giving credit when necessary :contentReference[oaicite:0]{index=0}  

##  Features & Content

- Four main sections and a footer, structured and styled using Flexbox :contentReference[oaicite:1]{index=1}  
- Hero section with heading and placeholder imagery — fonts and colors informed by the design (Roboto used in the template) :contentReference[oaicite:2]{index=2}  
- Ease of flexibility: margins and spacing approximate the design (e.g., using `margin: 24px` instead of precise pixel counts) :contentReference[oaicite:3]{index=3}  
- Option to swap in your own branding, content, and imagery for personalization :contentReference[oaicite:4]{index=4}  
- Proper attribution for any external images sourced from Pexels, Pixabay, or Unsplash :contentReference[oaicite:5]{index=5}
